# Adaptive-Filter-with-Detection-System
The adaptive filter is based on the neural network as filtering method. 
The filter transforms the signal to a spectrogram including both time domain as x axis and frequency domain as y axis with Fourier Transform. 
In the filtering process it has its own detection system so that the system will filter the certain zone instead of the whole zone and the new filtering process will begin behind the end of last process. 
After the whole filtering process finish, the inverse Fourier Transform will change the signal back to time domain with magnitude.
